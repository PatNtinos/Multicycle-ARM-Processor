# üß† Multicycle ARM Processor (VHDL ‚Äì Vivado)

## üìò Overview
This project implements a **multicycle ARM processor** in **VHDL**, developed using **Xilinx Vivado IDE**.  
The design supports **data processing**, **memory**, and **branch instructions**, following a **multicycle execution model** to optimize hardware utilization while maintaining instruction flexibility.
Its architecture consists of a datapath and a control unit, with 25 individual components, each accompanied by dedicated testbenches to ensure correct functionality.
A custom ARM assembly program was included to verify and demonstrate the processor‚Äôs correct operation.

## üß© Design Architecture

### üîπ Datapath  
Handles data flow and arithmetic operations within the processor.  
Components include the **Program Counter (PC)**, **Instruction Memory**, **Register File**, **Extender**, **ALU**, **Status Register**, **Data Memory**, and several specialized **register modules** with reset and write-enable control.  
All modules are interconnected to form a complete and efficient execution pipeline.

### üîπ Processor Integration  
The **Datapath** and **Control Unit** were combined to form the full processor.  
Instruction memory was preloaded with ARM machine code for simulation and verification.

## üß™ Simulation & Testing
Functionality was verified through an **ARM assembly test program** loaded into instruction memory in **hexadecimal format**.  
The test covered arithmetic, logic, memory, and branching operations ‚Äî confirming correct multicycle execution and synchronization between datapath and control signals.

### üßæ Example Test Program
```asm
MAIN_PROGRAM:
MOV     R0, #5          ; R0 = 5
MOV     R1, #2          ; R1 = 2
ADD     R2, R0, R1      ; R2 = 7 , R2= R0+R1
SUB     R3, R2, #4      ; R3 = 3 , R3= R2-4
AND     R4, R2, R3      ; R4 = 7 & 3 = 3
ORR     R5, R4, #8      ; R5 = 3 | 8 = 11
EOR     R6, R5, R0      ; R6 = 11 xor 5 = 14
LSL     R7, R6, #1      ; R7 = 14 << 1 = 28
ASR     R8, R7, #2      ; R8 = 28 >> 2 = 7
CMP     R7, R8          ; compare 28 vs 7 (sets flags)
ADD     R9, R8, #9      ; R9 = 7 + 9 = 16
MVN     R10, R9         ; R10 = NOT(16)
BL      function        ; call function
STR     R10, [R0, #12]  ; store R10 at [R0+12]
LDR     R11, [R0, #12]  ; load R11 = R10
B MAIN_PROGRAM;

function:
MOV R3, #8; R3 = 8
MOV R4, #2; R4 = 2
ADD R7, R3, R4;
MOV PC, LR; Return to MAIN_PROGRAM
