# Multicycle-ARM-Processor
Designed and implemented a multicycle ARM processor in VHDL using Vivado IDE as part of a Masterâ€™s in Digital Systems Design. The processor supports data processing, memory, and branch instructions. Each module was verified through comprehensive testbenches, ensuring functional accuracy, timing efficiency, and design scalability.
